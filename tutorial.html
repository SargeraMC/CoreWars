                <b>#1 Introduction</b>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    To get started, you'll want to run off from spawn and find a safe place.
                    Once you've found a safe place, you can place your generator down. Your generator is your source of gold. You can see how
                    much gold you have on your sidebar. <br></br>Be careful, though, people can fight you and break your generator if they find you!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box"> 
                <b>#2 Generators</b>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Generators are your source of income. To start producing gold, place down your generator and it will produce gold every 8 seconds.
                    To withdraw this gold, you can either shift-click on it, or open the GUI by right clicking on the generator. Here you will also find
                    various upgrade options such as:
                    <br></br>

                    <li>Level: How much gold is produced by your generator every 8 seconds</li>
                    <li>Storage: How much gold your generator can store before it stops producing.</li>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box"> 
                <b>#3 Supply Crates</b>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Around the map, you will find shulker boxes of different colors. The items you find in these shulker boxes will depend 
                    on the color of the shulker. The supply crates will contain useful items such as:
                    
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Combat Items: Anything from wooden to diamond swords/armor can be found.</li>
                    <li>Defensive Blocks: These Blocks can be used in building your base.</li>
                    <li>Generators: You can find extra generators with different storage/level values too!</li>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box"> 
                <b>#4 Base Building</b>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Once you've found some blocks, you should build your base. This will make a safe place for you to place your
                    generators and produce gold in peace. There are different tiers of blocks, which will have different health and therefore
                    will take different damage from TNT depending on the tier.<br></br>

                    To build a base, you will first need to place a core. These can be found around the map in shulkers.<br></br>

                    <li>These blocks, in order, are: Stripped Oak Wood, Polished Diorite, Polished Andesite & Smooth Slab.</li>
                    <li>There are also door varieties of these blocks, including: Oak Door, Spruce Door & Iron Doors.</li>

            <div class="box"> 
                <b>#5 Combat</b>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    From killing other players, you will get gold and experience. Be careful though, if you kill the same player too much in a short space of time,
                    you will trigger the anti-kil farming check.<br></br>
                    <li>Note: Combat Items (e.g. sword, armour) are lost on death. All other items are kept.</li>
                </p>

            <div class="box"> 
                <b>#6 Prestige | $100 Prestige Top Reward</b>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    The end objective of this server is to achieve the highest rank of prestige that you can. Whoever achieves the highest prestige by the end of
                    the season will get the $100 PayPal reward. Prestiging will cost you money and will have a level requirement. However, in return you will receive
                    a 0.2x booster increase (this will scale with donation boosters).
